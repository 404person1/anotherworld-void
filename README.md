# ARBITRARY REMAKE AND PORT OF TOUHOUMON ANOTHER WORLD REVISED

This project is intended to be a decomp remake/port of [Touhoumon: Another World Revised, by BluShell](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/touhoumon-another-world-revised-world-link-revised-v1-10-3-released.497990/).
I probably won't implement any generational mechanics from Pok√©mon like mega evolution, and I have no plans on implementing fairy type.
I DO however plan on adding dolls up to Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, and if I'm lucky, Hidden Star in Four Seasons (but dont count on that), 
overhauling some of the currently available roster (to decrease how important having a 120 speed mon is), and hopefully adding some other miscellaneous dolls.
No ETA on this; I still need to figure out how to do some things.

## TO DO, PREFERABLY IN THIS ORDER:
- Revert the 1.8 type chart changes
- Change the type chart to be mostly equivalent to Revised (I'm not making steel effective against electric or taking away poison's resistance to fighting)
- Change the status orb timing to be congruent with Revised (end of turn instead of end of next turn)
- Implement custom moves and move renames from Revised; excluding Mana Punch, I'm gonna keep that as Zen Headbutt (animations later)
- Ability renames, to be congruent with Revised
- Ability changes, if there are any
- Implement base stats of Bon√©ka
- Sprites and animations
- therapy
- Cries
- Map out Gensokyo
- Map out Kanto
- therapy 
- Actually implement the gameplay
- Optionally, overhaul Kanto (Revised already laid the groundwork)
- Even more optionally, overhaul Gensokyo
- Implement options to: remove IVs from stat calculations, disable EVs as an extra challenge option
- Probably disable dex descriptions; some of these weirdos have basically no info, and the X Bon√©ka are goofy, suped-up legendaries
- therapy

### Why Kanto?
because i like kanto. i also have a lot of ideas for editing the region so i dont mind porting kanto over.
having the systems from emerald would also be helpful

I'll add credits as time goes on
